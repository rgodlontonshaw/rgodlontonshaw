# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

A Creative engineer in **Blockchain** and **Mobile** tech.

I was drawn to the storytelling power of digital multi-media in my early developmet days - the ability to teach and educate through technoglogy to millions across the world. That evolved into a passion for mobile - creating technology that has a reach for users across the globe. Thatâ€™s when mobile development became my world, where I spent years crafting apps and experiences that live in peopleâ€™s pockets.

In recent years, a new spark has taken hold: **Blockchain**.

More specifically, Iâ€™ve found myself fully immersed in the **Solana** ecosystem â€” exploring its speed, potential, and how itâ€™s shaping the next era of the internet. Iâ€™m building smart contracts using `Rust` and `Anchor`, and I absolutely love it.

Why Rust?

Because it just makes sense. Itâ€™s robust, safe, performant, and feels like a real language for builders who care about every byte. I love languages that challenge me to think deeply and write better code. Rust gives me that â€” and the cross-platform power to build almost anywhere.

Now, Iâ€™m blending all my skills into something new â€” a fusion of creativity, logic, and next-gen tech. Iâ€™m not here just to follow trends. Iâ€™m here to **craft tools**, **create value**, and help shape the future â€” one block at a time.
